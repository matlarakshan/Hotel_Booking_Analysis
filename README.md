# Hotel Booking Analysis

Problem Statement :
For this project we will be analyzing Hotel Booking data. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children and
or babies, and the number of available parking spaces. Hotel industry is a very volatile industry and the bookings depends on above factors and many more. The main objective behind this project is to explore and analyze data to discover important factors that govern the bookings and give Insights to hotel management.
The aim of this study is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of hotel booking data to uncover valuable insights and patterns that can inform strategic decisions for a hotel business. The analysis will focus on understanding booking trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing booking cancellations.

Project Summary :
As an overview, hotel reservation systems typically work by allowing guests to reserve the dates for their stay based on the real-time display of your rates and inventory across all booking channels and finalise their reservation through an online payment portal.

A hotel booking system helps streamline your operations by automating many of these tasks. For example, you can set up automatic confirmation emails to be sent to guests when they make a reservation. This saves you a lot of time and ensures that your guests always have the latest information about their reservation.

In addition, a hotel booking system can help you track your staff's performance and sales. This data can be extremely valuable in identifying areas of improvement and taking action to improve your hotel's overall performance.

For the given Dataset we have

*   Shown Dataset Information
*   Understanding our dataset
*   Data Vizualization
*   Storytelling & Experimenting with charts
*   Understand the relationships between variables

Business Objective : 
The EDA of hotel booking data is expected to yield actionable insights that can guide the hotel management in making informed decisions, such as optimizing pricing strategies, refining marketing efforts, enhancing guest experience, and revising cancellation policies. Additionally, this analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of customer behavior and industry dynamics, enabling the hotel to stay competitive and adaptive in a rapidly changing market.

The EDA will involve data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and exploratory techniques. Python programming and relevant libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) will be utilized for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis will be documented through visualizations, summary statistics, and concise reports to present findings and insights effectively.

The main goal of online hotel booking systems is to give clients a quick and easy way to make hotel reservations. This includes offering a user-friendly interface, safe payment processing, and access to the most recent data regarding available rooms. These systems should also be able to handle reservations rapidly so that clients can promptly receive the space they require. Overall, it seems that the majority of online hotel reservation systems in use today are accomplishing these goals. Customers may quickly complete the transaction without any problems or delays and have access to extensive information about each property before making their booking decision.
